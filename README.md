### Project Description
Cursor Zoo is a fun, animated website where your cursor transforms into a hyperactive creature. It leaves glitter, flashes random thoughts, and acts like it has a mind of its own. It's a chaotic celebration of nonsense.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Cursors are way too well-behaved. Nobody asked for it, but we thought it was about time someone gave cursors the freedom to go wild. After all, how can you focus when your pointer isn‚Äôt sparkling or roaring?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We turned your plain, responsible pointer into a zoo exhibit. It glows, jumps, spins, throws emojis, and occasionally predicts your future (badly). It doesn‚Äôt solve anything‚Äîexcept the crushing seriousness of everyday life.
